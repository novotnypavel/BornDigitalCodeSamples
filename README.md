# Born Digital Code Samples

## Medical_costs_ml_docker_flask
- Simpe ML model predicts medical costs of healthcare insurance companies of their patients (RF regressor)
- Flask was used to build API for model serving
- Dockerfile is included to build docker image from it
- * The API works, however a bug with pickle prevents the model from predicting when trying to preprocess the test data, has to be fixed.
- Some parts (specially in test data preprocessing) could have been coded neater
